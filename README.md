Esri Story Maps are open source web applications that let authors combine authoritative maps with narrative text, images, and multimedia content. The multimedia content provided by authors are hosted at the ESRI ArcGIS online cloud, while the web application template can be download from GitHub, customized and host on your own server. This article explains how to deploy the story map on your web server. 

This repository contains the source code of the Middletown story map application.  A minified(compiled) code is available in the Deploy folder.
